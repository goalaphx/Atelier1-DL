This project encompasses two distinct parts: Regression analysis applied to stock market data for price prediction and a deep learning classification project. Both leverage the power of deep learning to extract insights and build predictive models.

## Part 1: Stock Market Regression Analysis

This section focuses on predicting stock closing prices using historical data and deep learning regression techniques.

### Overview

The goal is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the closing price of a stock based on its historical performance.  This involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to understand model performance and stock trends.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of historical stock market data, with the following key features:

*   **date:** The date of the stock record.  (YYYY-MM-DD Format)
*   **symbol:** The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOG).
*   **open:** The opening price of the stock for the day (in USD).
*   **close:** The closing price of the stock for the day (in USD) - **Target Variable**.
*   **low:** The lowest price of the stock during the day (in USD).
*   **high:** The highest price of the stock during the day (in USD).
*   **volume:** The number of shares traded during the day.

The data can be sourced from various online financial data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud.  Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are crucial for optimal model performance.

### Implementation

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
    *   Loading the stock market data from a CSV or API.
    *   Handling missing values (e.g., imputation with mean/median or removal).
    *   Ensuring data types are correct (e.g., converting date to datetime objects).
    *   Feature scaling (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) to normalize the input features.
    *   Creating lagged features (e.g., previous day's closing price) to incorporate time-series dependencies.

2.  **Model Training:**
    *   Splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.  A typical split might be 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.
    *   Defining a deep learning regression model using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) like LSTMs are suitable choices.
    *   Choosing an appropriate loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error - MSE) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
    *   Training the model on the training data and monitoring performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
    *   Implementing techniques like dropout or early stopping to further prevent overfitting.

3.  **Evaluation:**
    *   Evaluating the trained model on the test set using metrics such as:
        *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  Average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
        *   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of the MSE, providing a more interpretable error value in the original unit.
        *   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
        *   **R-squared (R²):** Proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables.
    *   Visualizing predicted vs. actual closing prices on a plot to assess the model's performance visually.
    *   Analyzing residual plots (predicted - actual) to check for any patterns that might indicate model bias.

### Results

The model was trained on [mention the time period of the data used] historical stock data. The performance was evaluated based on the test set. Key results include:

*   **MSE:** [Insert MSE Value]
*   **RMSE:** [Insert RMSE Value]
*   **MAE:** [Insert MAE Value]
*   **R²:** [Insert R² Value]

The visualizations clearly show [Describe the observed trends in the predicted vs. actual price plot, e.g., "the model captures the general trend but struggles with large price fluctuations."]. The residual analysis revealed [Describe any patterns observed in the residual plot, e.g., "no significant patterns, suggesting the model is relatively unbiased."].

**Potential Improvements:**

*   Incorporate more features, such as technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) or sentiment analysis data from news articles.
*   Experiment with different model architectures, such as LSTMs or transformers, which are better suited for time series data.
*   Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.

## Part 2: Deep Learning Classification Project

This section covers the implementation of a deep learning model for a classification task.

### Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify data into distinct categories.  The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation and interpretation.

### Dataset

*   **Description:** [Provide a brief description of the dataset, including the number of samples, number of features, and the class distribution.] For example: "The dataset consists of [Number] images of [Objects]. Each image is labeled with one of [Number] classes: [Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, ...]. The dataset is [Balanced/Imbalanced] with respect to class distribution."
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values (for images) or numerical features to a standard range (e.g., 0-1).
    *   **Data Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets.  A typical split is 70/15/15.
    *   **Data Augmentation (if applicable):** Applying transformations to the training data (e.g., rotations, flips, zooms) to increase the dataset size and improve model generalization.  This is particularly useful for image classification tasks.
